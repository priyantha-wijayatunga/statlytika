    <h3>Predicting severe medical conditions of patients with traumatic brain injury</h3>
    <p>I have developed an effective and operational method to predict accurately,  rare or extreme events happening over time using multiple time series data. When it is needed to predict relatively rare events of elevated intracranial blood pressure (ICP) of patients with brain traumatic injuries within the next hour or so from their clinical condition of the last few hours, I developed a probabilistic model to do it with highest accuracy. The idea is not just to use raw data, but extract features from them, e.g., oscillation patterns, spikes, etc. in the selected time intervals of the past. Severe elevations of ICP, that are rare are difficult to predict with traditional prediction models such as neural networks, etc. So, I invented a novel method which calibrate and weigh predictive probabilities in order to select predictions. The method works in such a way that it gives enhanced predictions for the rare events of severe levels of ICP (the ICP level 2) while losing slightly prediction accuracy for normal levels of ICP (the ICP level 1), for the first to the sixth ten-minute time intervals into the future. The weighing of predictive probabilities is done in order to select predictions through minimizing a prediction error loss function that has different losses for different errors..</p>
                        <p> The model is probabilistic therefore it can incorporate other information types as past ECG signal variation, respiration pattern, blood pressure variation, etc. of the patient. In fact, in this work no such extra knowledge could improve prediction accuracies. But my proposed method can be useful in other cases. This model can be used to predict stock market, exchange rate, interest rate, etc. prediction from multiple sources of data. And it is applicable for prediction of medical conditions of patients with clinical information over the time. And so on. </p>

    <h3>Bankruptcy Risk Prediction</h3>
    <p> I have shown that when predictions are done where predicting some events that are minority are more important than the others that are the majority, probabilistic prediction models such as naive Bayesian networks can be constructed in such a way that we get higher prediction accuracies for important events while losing a little bit of prediction accuracy for unimportant events. My novel model (naiveB*) attained 92% accuracy of prediction for companies that are at risk of bankruptcy (EC=1) and 93% of accuracy of prediction for those are not at risk of bankruptcy at all (EC=3). All other models such as neural networks fail to attain such high prediction accuracies for the important events, but work well for unimportant events, which is not desired for investors and other business professionals. This model can be used to predict rare and important events of interest in many business, scientific, etc. contexts..</p>

    <h3>Building a non-linear correlation measure</h3>
    <p>Using a general form of probability distance metric, namely, Hellinger distance I obtained a generalized version of the Pearson’s correlation coefficient for two ordinal variables such as educational status and socio-economic status of people or similar cases. It can measure any type of stochastic dependence accurately. For continuous variables like age, weight, etc.  optimal categorization is needed, as in case of popular maximal information coefficient (MIC). However the measure I obtained is more accurate. And I have shown that any good measure of dependence is computational, even if it has a closed form formula.  High level of  accuracy is obtained through, on one hand, using an accurate normalization for probability distance used to build the measure, that is the distance between the existing phenomenon of dependence and its assumed independence. And on the other hand, using a general metric distance that is independent of the nature of the dependence. Some researchers have implemented it in R and  made available over the internet:  <a href="https://rdrr.io/github/vthorrf/wijayatunga/man/wcor.html">wcor: Wijayatunga coefficient</a>. The measure can be useful in genetic association studies, socio-economic studies where sample survey data consist of a lot of categorical variables. .</p>
